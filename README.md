# Spring Boot for MS SQL

To get this app running, copy `src/main/resources/application.properties_example` to
`src/main/resources/application.properties` and make sure the JDBC URL looks sane. After that, you should be able to
start with `mvn spring-boot:run` and opening http://localhost:8080/dbtest to make sure everything is OK.
